# LightBox2-Jquery
Photo viewer called LightBox2.

How to build a lightbox2:

http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
download,
C:\Users\Mike-321191\Downloads\lightbox2-master.zip\lightbox2-master\dist
copy from this download the three files: CSS, JS, images, into your website. 

Put these two links in the head:
link href="css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"
link href="css/lightbox.css" rel="stylesheet"

Put this link in just before the close of the body tag:
C:\Users\Mike-321191\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\WebSites\LightBox2\js\lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js

Name your lightbox2 accordingly, so that all pictures refer to that one lightbox2, to create a photo album.

You can install LightBox if required, and I call it from the Google API link in this website.
